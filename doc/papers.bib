	a hierarchical process combining global descriptors computed onto
	cubic interpolation of triangular mesh and patches correlation around
	Harris corners. To evaluate this method, three large images data
	sets have been used. Results of the proposed method are compared

	1) accuracy, 2) amount of memorized data required per image and 3)
	computational cost. The proposed method shows the best compromise

	Each altitude constrains the viewer to a circle on the surface of
	a celestial body, called the circle of equal altitude. A set of circles
	of equal altitude can be intersected to yield viewer position. We
	use this principle to obtain the position on Earth. Since altitude
	measurements are corrupted by noise, a least-square estimate is numerically

	sensing. We present probabilistic techniques that represent and update

	sensor and orientation sensor for wearable computer users. Many user
	localization methods have been investigated to realize location-based
	services in a wide environment. The localization methods usually
	employ a hybrid approach in which user's position is estimated by
	using positioning infrastructures and dead reckoning such as a pedometer.
	However, the installation cost of infrastructures increases when
	the area expands, and the error of the pedometer is frequently caused
	by failures in walking locomotion detection and the difference between
	ideal and estimated step lengths. If the relative distance is accurately
	estimated by dead reckoning approach, the installation cost of infrastructures
	can be reduced. This paper proposes a new localization method that
	improves the estimation accuracy of step length in dead reckoning
	approach. The proposed method measures user's orientation and geometrical
	relationship between user's heel and waist with an orientation sensor
	and an electromagnetic tracker attached to user's body. When both
	feet come into contact with the ground, user's position is updated
	by adding the estimated step length which means the relationship
	between user's heels and the position estimated in the previous step.
	The proposed localization method has been experimented using a prototype
	system to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.},

	signal strength need good calibration method to improve the accuracy
	of position estimation system. In this paper we use grey prediction
	method in wireless sensor network and employ wireless LAN medium
	(Zigbee/802.15.4). The grey prediction is used to predict the tendency
	of RSSI (received signal strength indicator), and we also designed
	dynamic triangular (DTN) location method. We have done some experiments
	and compare with other classical location finding methods. The mean
	distant error of RSSI on mobile user can be within 2.3 m at offline
	stage. As a result, grey predication with DTN provides more accurate
	predicted position and carries out mean distance error within 1.3
	m at run-time stage.},

	improve the performance of appearance-based localization methods
	that perform image retrieval in large data sets. This feature is
	integrated with a vision-based algorithm that allows both topological
	and metric localization using omnidirectional images in a hierarchical
	approach. It uses pyramidal kernels for the topological localization
	and three-view geometric constraints for the metric one. Experiments
	with several omnidirectional images sets are shown, including comparisons
	with other typically used features (radial lines and SIFT). The advantages
	of this approach are proved, showing the use of SURF as the best
	compromise between efficiency and accuracy in the results.},

	“loop closing” is the task of deciding whether or not a vehicle has,
	after an excursion of arbitrary length, returned to a previously
	visited area. Reliable loop closing is both essential and hard. It
	is without doubt one of the greatest impediments to long term, robust
	SLAM. This paper illustrates how visual features, used in conjunction
	with scanning laser data, can be used to a great advantage. We use
	the notion of visual saliency to focus the selection of suitable
	(affine invariant) image-feature descriptors for storage in a database.
	When queried with a recently taken image the database returns the
	capture time of matching images. This time information is used to
	discover loop closing events. Crucially this is achieved independently
	of estimated map and vehicle location. We integrate the above technique
	into a SLAM algorithm using delayed vehicle states and scan matching
	to form interpose geometric constraints. We present initial results
	using this system to close loops (around 100m) in an indoor environment.

	is developed. The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting
	for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports.
	As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for
	the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets
	in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is
	false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association
	hypothesis using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received,
	the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively
	using all available information such as density of unknown targets,
	density of false targets, probability of detection, and location
	uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement
	with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To
	keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are
	eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined.
	To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets
	and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently.
	In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully
	tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.},

	Saliency is computed as a measure of interest at every image location,
	efficiently directing the time-consuming landmark identification
	process towards the most likely candidate locations in the image.
	The gist and salient landmark features are then further processed
	using a Monte-Carlo localization algorithm to allow the robot to

	for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office

	and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors
	that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize
	over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence
	and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm
	has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback

	mobile robot systems. Visual place recognition, as opposed to purely
	geometrical models, holds promise of higher flexibility and association
	of semantics to the model. Ideally, a place recognition algorithm
	should be robust to dynamic changes and it should perform consistently
	when recognizing a room (for instance a corridor) in different geographical
	locations. Also, it should be able to categorize places, a crucial
	capability for transfer of knowledge and continuous learning. In
	order to test the suitability of visual recognition algorithms for
	these tasks, this paper presents a new database, acquired in three
	different labs across Europe. It contains image sequences of several
	rooms under dynamic changes, acquired at the same time with a perspective
	and omnidirectional camera, mounted on a socket. We assess this new
	database with an appearance- based algorithm that combines local
	features with support vector machines through an ad-hoc kernel. Results
	show the effectiveness of the approach and the value of the database.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object
	detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly
	and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by
	three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image
	representation called the "integral image" which allows the features
	used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a
	learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number
	of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely
	efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining
	increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows
	background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending
	more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can
	be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which
	unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded
	regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain
	of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to
	the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector
	runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing
	or skin color detection.},
